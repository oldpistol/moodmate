- Provide mood history for reflection
- Offer simple self-care tips (MVP)

## 3. Target Users
- Students and young adults who want a simple daily mood tracking routine

## 4. MVP Scope
### In-Scope
- Mood Check-in (mood + optional note)
- Mood History (list + entry details)
- Tips page (static)
- Basic navigation + empty states

### Out-of-Scope (for now)
- Social/community features
- AI prediction / advanced analytics
- Multi-device cloud sync (optional later)

## 5. Expected Deliverables
- Product backlog (prioritized)
- Requirement analysis (FR/NFR)
- UML diagrams
- Wireframes (low-fi & high-fi)
- Working prototype (Flutter)
