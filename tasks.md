## Notes

- **Dependencies** indicate which tasks should be completed before starting a given task
- **Priority** levels help focus development efforts on core features first
- Some tasks can be worked on in parallel if dependencies allow
- Consider breaking down larger tasks into smaller subtasks during sprint planning
- Regularly review and update this task list as requirements evolve
